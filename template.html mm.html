            <p>Crow is a Legendary Brawler that has low health, and a low damaging attack that poisons enemies to deal extra damage over time with his long-ranged daggers. He has great mobility with his Super and his very fast movement speed. He attacks by firing 3 long-ranged daggers that inflict poison on his enemies and decrease healing by 25% (from any source) which makes him a good counter against support brawlers. Crow's Super makes him jump and land, throwing poisonous daggers around him upon take-off and landing. His first Gadget, Defense Booster, grants him a temporary damage-reducing shield. His second Gadget, Slowing Toxin, slows all poisoned enemies temporarily for 2 seconds. His Mythic Gear, Enduring Toxins, increases his poison damage by 30%. His first Star Power, Extra Toxic, moderately decreases the damage output of a poisoned enemy. His second Star Power, Carrion Crow, makes enemies with less than 50% of their maximum health take much more damage from Crow's daggers (does affect pets/turrets). His Hypercharge, Utility Knives, makes his Super throw and return poisonous daggers around him upon take-off and landing allowing massive damage up close.</p>
